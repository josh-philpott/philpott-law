<h2>What constitutes an Assault and Battery in Florida?</h2>
<p>Florida law defines an assault as an intentional, unlawful threat to do violence to another person, coupled with an
	ability to carry it out, and doing some act that creates a well-founded fear of imminent harm in another person.</p>
<p><em>Simple assault</em> is a second-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a fine of up to
	$500.00. An assault or battery can have aggravating factors that can increase the severity of punishment, such as
	using a gun or weapon. Significantly, anything can be used as a weapon, such as a thrown glass, cell phone or even a
	ham sandwich! Use of a weapon may increase a misdemeanor to a felony. A <em>3rd degree felony</em> is punishable by
	up to five years in prison and a $5000.00 fine. </p>
<p><strong><em>It is important to understand that an assault need not result in physical harm. A threat of harm may be
			enough to be charged. Below are some examples:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Throwing an object at someone during an argument.</li>
	<li>Taking a swing at someone but missing.</li>
	<li>Grabbing or shaking someone.</li>
	<li>Threatening to harm or kill someone.</li>
</ul>
