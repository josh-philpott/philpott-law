<h2>The specific penalties for a drug offense depend on:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>The type of crime</em></strong> - Possession is considered the least serious of drug offenses, with
		trafficking and Conspiracy to Traffick being among the most serious. Importantly, a charge of conspiracy to
		traffick does not require the actual sale of narcotics, only that you entered into an agreement to purchase or
		sell with others. </li>
	<br>

	<li><strong><em>The type and kind of drugs involved</em></strong> - Drugs are ranked from Schedule 1 to Schedule 4
		depending upon their potential for abuse. A Schedule 4 narcotic has the lowest potential for abuse. Drugs such
		as heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl are considered Schedule 1, and are most addictive, while Tylenol would
		be considered a Schedule 4 drug.<strong></strong></li>
	<br>

	<li><strong><em>Criminal History</em></strong> - If you are charged for the first-time with a drug crime you may be
		eligible for an alternative sentence such as drug court or other diversion program. However, if you have
		committed multiple offenses then you may face enhanced penalties including minimum mandatory prison sentences.
		<strong></strong>
	</li><br>


	<li><strong><em>Other Factors</em></strong> - If your drug charge also involved the use of a weapon or if committed
		in close proximity to a school or playground then you may face enhanced penalties.<strong></strong></li>
