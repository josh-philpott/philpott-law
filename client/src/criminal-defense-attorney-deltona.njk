    Beach, or surrounding Volusia County, a Criminal Defense Attorney may be able to have your criminal record sealed or
    expunged, even if you already plead no contest or guilty?</p>
<p>Our attorneys at Philpott Law have the experience and integrity to assist you through the record sealing and
    expunging process to ensure that your rights are restored so that you can continue to live your life freely.</p>
<h2>Criminal Defense Attorney Danny Philpott Will Fight for You</h2>
<p>Not everyone who is arrested and charged with a crime will be brought to trial or even found guilty. Police do make
    mistakes and sometimes they arrest the wrong person, or the prosecuting attorney may decide there is not enough
    evidence to obtain a guilty verdict.</p>
<p>Since Florida has strict requirements for sealing or expunging criminal records, it is strongly recommended that
    individuals seek the assistance of a Criminal Defense Attorney serving the Deltona area.</p>
<p>Our Criminal Defense Lawyers will be able to help determine if you are eligible for this one-time legal option to
    have a criminal record sealed or expunged. For a free consultation, <a href="/contact/">contact
