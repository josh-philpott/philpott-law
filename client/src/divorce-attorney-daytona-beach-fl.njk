<h2>Dissolution of Marriage</h2>
<p>Unlike many other states, here in the State of Florida, a spouse does not need grounds for divorce in order to file
    for dissolution of marriage. However, the spouse must be a current state resident who has resided in the state for
    at least six consecutive months. </p>
<h2>Simple Divorce</h2>
<p>One of the most frequently asked questions concerning a divorce or dissolution of marriage is whether they need a
    Divorce Attorney for a simple divorce.</p>
<p>While it is possible to file a divorce without a lawyer when there are no minor children or joint assets involved,
    spouses are advised to consult with a Divorce Attorney as mistakes can be time consuming, frustrating, and costly.
</p>
<p>Your Divorce Lawyer at Philpott Law will ensure your documents are completed accurately, and will answer any legal
    questions you may have regarding the process. </p>
<h2>Property Distribution</h2>
<p>The State of Florida is an equitable property distribution state. This means that all assets acquired during the
    marriage, regardless of who actually purchased or gifted the asset, will be subject to equal distribution. The
    family court will split the marital assets as close to 50-50 as possible during the divorce proceedings. </p>
<h2>Child Custody</h2>
<p>Although one parent may be designated as a primary custodian, Florida requires both parents to share equally in the
    financial, health, education, and emotional well-being of raising their minor child or children.</p>
<p>During a divorce, both parents will be required to submit an acceptable Parental Timesharing Agreement to the court,
    or the judge may define a plan for them that will become a lawful order.</p>
<p>Danny Philpott, your trusted and aggressive Divorce Lawyer in Daytona Beach, will help in the preparation of the
    required parental agreement. You can also contact us to prepare a petition for the Modification of Timesharing
    Agreement.</p>
