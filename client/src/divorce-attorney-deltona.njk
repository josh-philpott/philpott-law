<p>Divorce happens. You shouldn't be ashamed, scared, or angry to be facing one: in fact, think of the freedom and
    peace-of-mind you will have when this rocky situation is resolved. Many divorces, however, do involve complicated
    situations like family-owned businesses, child custody arrangements and substantial assets such as 401(k)s. </p>
<p>The outcome of how these items are handled, as well as the overall results of your divorce, can depend on who you
    have on your side, or who you have to count on, to come to your aid as you work to settle things in your favor (or
    at least in a manner that's fair to all parties involved). </p>
<h2>The Power of a Local Divorce &amp; Family Law Firm</h2>
<p>A big firm can't give you the attention and dedication you need and deserve during a dissolution of marriage. Count
    on the direct, personalized counsel you'll receive from the Divorce Lawyers at Philpott Law. Right now, your
    happiness and wellbeing depends on it. </p>
