<h2>Family Law Attorney</h2>
<p>When you are contemplating a divorce, it is essential to consult with an experienced <a href="/family-law/">family
        law attorney</a> as soon as possible. A family
    lawyer can provide you with unbiased advice that is in your best interest. Hiring a good lawyer is like having both
    a coach and a referee on your side. A lawyer will provide guidance on what you should and should not do, according
    to Florida law, so you can avoid making costly legal or financial mistakes. And a lawyer will take the necessary
    legal action and represent you in all court proceedings to protect your rights and help you achieve the desired
    outcome. During a divorce, known as dissolution of marriage in Florida, you will have many questions about what
    constitutes marital assets, alimony, child support, and more. That's why you need to hire a divorce attorney sooner
    than later.</p>
<h2>DUI Attorney</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, the State of Florida has been cracking down on DUI offenses with stiff fines and
    possible jail time, even for first offenders. At Philpott Law, our firm is in the position to provide you with an
    aggressive DUI attorney to mount your legal defense. As a former Assistant State Attorney in Volusia County,
    Attorney Philpott has successfully prosecuted many criminal cases, including DUI.</p>
<p>If you have been arrested or charged with a DUI, you have rights. That is why you must consult with an aggressive DUI
    attorney as soon as possible. The State must be able to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. We will review
    the facts of the case to develop an aggressive defense strategy designed to help protect your driving privileges and
    your ability to earn a living for you and your family.</p>
