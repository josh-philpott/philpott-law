<h2>Why You Need a Divorce Lawyer</h2>
<p>In the State of Florida, a divorce is called a dissolution of marriage. Since divorces can be a complex and
    emotionally charged issue, anyone thinking about getting a divorce should consult with a Family Law Attorney with
    experience in divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>A Divorce Attorney gives you unbiased legal advice that is in your best interest, negotiates on your behalf, and
    represents you in all court proceedings to protect your rights.</p>
<h2>Dissolution of Marriage</h2>
<p>Unlike many other states, Florida does not require a spouse to have grounds for divorce. The spouse can declare that
    the marriage is irretrievably broken to petition the court for dissolution of marriage.</p>
<p>Divorces are often not as simple as many may believe, especially when there are assets, investments, and minor
    children. Florida is an “equitable distribution” state, meaning that assets acquired during the marriage (marital
    assets) shall be distributed equally. This is also where a point in contention often occurs.</p>
<p>A Divorce Lawyer can help determine your marital vs non-marital assets to ensure that you receive the monies, real
    estate, investments, and other assets that are rightfully yours.</p>
<h2>Are You Eligible for Alimony?</h2>
<p>Some spouses seeking divorce want to know if they are entitled to alimony. During divorce proceedings, family court
    will review the income of both parties, and the length of the marriage to calculate alimony payments.</p>
<p>When the income of a spouse is severely limited as a result of the divorce, the court may award alimony for a
    specified period of time. This is in addition to any child support that the court may order.</p>
<p>An experienced Divorce Attorney like Danny Philpott will negotiate on your behalf to ensure you receive the desired
    settlement for your dissolution of marriage.</p>
