<h2>Get a Second Chance After a Conviction</h2>
<p>Many individuals who have been convicted of a criminal offense in DeBary, don't realize that there is a local
    Criminal Defense Attorney who can help in having certain types of criminal records expunged or sealed. His name is
    Danny Philpott.</p>
<p>Our record sealing and expunging services are available throughout Volusia County in areas such as DeLand, Deltona,
    Orange City, Daytona Beach, and more.</p>
<h2>A Criminal Record Doesn't Have to Hold You Back</h2>
<p>There are many ways in which a criminal record can impact the rest of your life. For instance, a criminal record can
    prevent you from getting into certain colleges and universities. Many employers also frown upon hiring individuals
    with a criminal record. This applies even if you were arrested for a crime but were never convicted.</p>
<p>However, the State of Florida provides an opportunity for some individuals to either <a
        href="/criminal-defense/record-seals-expungements/">seal or expunge</a> their
    criminal record and get a second chance. It is important to contact an experienced and committed Criminal Defense
    Attorney to discuss your options as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Things to Consider When Sealing or Expunging Your Record</h2>
<p> An expunged criminal record is the ultimate goal because when a criminal record is expunged, employers, private
    investigators, schools, and other individuals will no longer be able to retrieve information regarding your arrest
    or conviction when running a background check on you.</p>
<p>You will also be granted the right to not have to disclose this information when asked on an application whether or
    not you have ever been convicted of a crime.</p>

<p> While expunging a criminal record erases the criminal history in most cases, it is important to note that there are
    some exceptions to this rule. For instance, if you attempt to get a job within the criminal justice, educational, or
    child welfare system, you will still be required to disclose your criminal history under Florida law. Some law
    enforcement agencies will also be able to access this information; however, they will be required to have a court
    order to do so.</p>
<h2>In Your Defense &amp; By Your Side</h2>
<p>The first step towards having a criminal record expunged is to file an application of eligibility with the Florida
    Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE).</p>
<p>If your eligibility application is approved, your request will be heard by a judge. It can take several months from
    the time you initiate proceedings for a final decision to be made. Furthermore, the process of successfully
    expunging your record can be quite complicated and require the filing of multiple petitions with the court.</p>
<p>In order to increase your chances of success and avoid any unnecessary delays in this complicated process, it is
    always best to work closely with an experienced Criminal Defense Attorney like Danny Philpott.</p>
