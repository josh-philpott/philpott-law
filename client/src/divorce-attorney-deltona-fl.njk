<h2>Danny Philpott is Your Trusted Family Law Lawyer</h2>
<p>When you need an aggressive Divorce Lawyer in Deltona, or the surrounding areas of DeLand, Orange City, Daytona
    Beach, or Sanford, you can count on Philpott Law to have your back. Divorce is not always a simple process,
    especially when there are minor children, property, and other financial assets involved.</p>
<p>Although Florida is an equitable distribution state, that doesn't necessarily mean that property will be distributed
    on a 50-50 basis. Also, the state does not require grounds for a divorce. This means that a spouse can begin the <a
        href="/family-law/dissolution-of-marriage-divorce/">dissolution of marriage</a>
    proceedings when they believe the marriage is no longer viable.</p>
<p>It's important for individuals to hire an aggressive Divorce Attorney who understands that divorce proceedings can be
    an emotional and time-consuming process, while at the same time offering the experience to resolve complex legal
    issues regarding child custody and support, alimony and the distribution of marital assets. </p>
<h2>You Don't Have to Go Through a Divorce Alone</h2>
<p>As your Divorce Lawyer, our goal is to resolve your divorce as expeditiously and as economical as possible. To that
    end, we work diligently resolving family issues whenever possible without having to undergo a trial; in fact, the
    courts would prefer that as well. Under Florida law, mediation is often required before a case can be heard in
    court. </p>
<p>Additionally, if there is a minor child or children, both parents are required to complete a Parental Time Sharing
    Agreement. In Florida, both parents are equally responsible for the education and care of their children regardless
    of which parent has primary custody.</p>
<p>Any changes to the parenting plan and time sharing schedule must be approved by the court. </p>
<h2>In Your Defense &amp; By Your Side</h2>
<p>During a divorce, emotions can run high. The decisions you make during a divorce could have an impact on your life
    for years to come. That's why you need an aggressive Divorce Attorney like Danny Philpott who can easily guide you
    through the legal process. </p>
